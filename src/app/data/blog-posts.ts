    excerpt: 'Walking into therapy without a plan is like going grocery shopping without a list. Here\'s how to show up prepared and make every minute count.',
    body: [
      'We\'ve all been there. You walk into your therapist\'s office, sit down, and suddenly your mind goes blank. That thing you\'ve been thinking about all week? Gone. The breakthrough you had at 2am on Tuesday? Completely evaporated.',
      'This isn\'t a memory problem. It\'s a preparation problem. And it has a simple fix.',
      '## Start a running list between sessions',
      'The moment something happens that you want to discuss — a conflict, a realization, a win, a setback — write it down. Don\'t wait. The half-life of an emotional insight is shorter than you think.',
      'Keep a running note on your phone, a dedicated journal, or use an app like Sessionly that\'s built specifically for this. The medium doesn\'t matter. What matters is that you capture it in the moment.',
      '## Prioritize before you walk in',
      'Twenty minutes before your session, review your list. You won\'t get to everything, so pick the 2-3 things that feel most important right now. Ask yourself: "If I could only talk about one thing today, what would it be?"',
      'This isn\'t about being rigid. Therapy should have room to breathe. But having a starting point means you don\'t waste the first ten minutes trying to figure out where to begin.',
      '## Bring the feelings, not just the facts',
      'When you log something, try to capture how it made you feel, not just what happened. "Mom called about Thanksgiving" is useful. "Mom called about Thanksgiving and I felt that familiar knot in my stomach — like I\'m 14 again and nothing I say matters" is powerful.',
      'Your therapist can work with emotions. Give them something to work with.',
      '## The bottom line',
      'Preparation isn\'t about controlling the session. It\'s about respecting your own time and making sure the things that matter don\'t slip through the cracks. You\'re investing in yourself every time you show up. Show up ready.',

    excerpt: 'Staring at a blank page is intimidating. These prompts will help you get past "I don\'t know what to write" and into the stuff that matters.',
    body: [
      'Journaling for therapy doesn\'t have to be poetic. It doesn\'t have to be long. It doesn\'t even have to make sense. The only requirement is honesty.',
      'But if you\'re staring at a blank page wondering where to start, here are some prompts that therapists actually recommend.',
      '## When you don\'t know what to write',
      '"Right now I feel..." — Just start with the emotion. Don\'t analyze it, don\'t judge it. Name it. Anxious. Irritated. Numb. Surprisingly okay. Whatever it is, write it down.',
      '"The thing I keep thinking about is..." — Your brain is chewing on something. Let it out on paper.',
      '"I noticed today that..." — Observations about your own behavior, reactions, or thought patterns are gold for therapy.',
      '## When something happened',
      '"This happened, and it made me feel..." — Capture the event and the emotional response. Your therapist will help you connect the dots.',
      '"I reacted by... but I wish I had..." — No judgment. Just noticing the gap between what you did and what you wanted to do.',
      '## When things are going well',
      'Don\'t only journal when things are hard. Capturing wins, positive moments, and progress is just as important. "I set a boundary today and it felt..." or "I noticed I didn\'t spiral when..." These entries become evidence of growth when you need it most.',
      '## Keep it real',
      'Your therapy journal is not for anyone else. It\'s not graded. It doesn\'t need to be articulate. The messier and more honest it is, the more useful it becomes. Write like nobody\'s reading — because nobody is.',

    body: [
      'Therapy only works if you\'re honest. And the things that feel hardest to say are usually the things that need to be said the most. Here are 10 things your therapist actually wants to hear.',
      '## 1. "I almost didn\'t come today"',
      'Resistance to therapy is data. Your therapist wants to understand what\'s behind it.',
      '## 2. "I don\'t think this is working"',
      'If you\'re feeling stuck, say so. A good therapist won\'t be offended — they\'ll adjust.',
      '## 3. "Something you said last time bothered me"',
      'Ruptures in the therapeutic relationship are normal and repairable. But only if you bring them up.',
      '## 4. "I lied about something before"',
      'It happens. Coming clean is more productive than carrying the weight of it.',
      '## 5. "I\'m embarrassed about this"',
      'Shame thrives in silence. Naming it takes away its power.',
      '## 6. "I don\'t know how I feel"',
      'Not knowing is a valid feeling. Your therapist can help you get curious about it.',
      '## 7. "I had a really good week"',
      'Positive updates matter. They help track progress and understand what\'s working.',
      '## 8. "I\'m thinking about stopping therapy"',
      'Whether you\'re ready to graduate or just feeling avoidant, this is worth exploring together.',
      '## 9. "I\'ve been comparing myself to other people"',
      'Comparison is universal and corrosive. It\'s worth unpacking.',
      '## 10. "There\'s something I\'ve never told anyone"',
      'Your therapist\'s office might be the safest place to start.',
      '## The takeaway',
      'Your therapist isn\'t there to judge you. They\'re there to help you understand yourself. The more honest you are, the more effective the work becomes.',

    title: 'Why You Forget What Happened in Therapy (And How to Fix It)',
    excerpt: 'You had a breakthrough in session, but by Thursday you can barely remember what it was. Here\'s why — and what to do about it.',
    body: [
      'It\'s Thursday evening. You had a great therapy session on Tuesday. You remember it felt important — maybe even transformative. But the specific insight? The exact thing your therapist said that shifted something? Fuzzy at best. Gone at worst.',
      'You\'re not losing your mind. This is completely normal, and there\'s a neuroscience-backed reason for it.',
      '## Your brain processes therapy differently',
      'Therapy often involves accessing emotional memories, which are stored differently than factual ones. When you\'re in an emotionally activated state, your prefrontal cortex (the planning, remembering part) takes a back seat to your limbic system (the feeling part).',
      'In other words: you were too busy feeling things to remember them clearly.',
      '## The forgetting curve is real',
      'Research shows we forget approximately 50% of new information within an hour, and up to 70% within 24 hours. Therapy insights are no exception. If you don\'t capture them soon after, they fade.',
      '## The fix: write within 30 minutes',
      'The single most effective thing you can do is write down what happened in your session within 30 minutes of leaving. It doesn\'t have to be detailed. Even bullet points help.',
      'What did you talk about? What surprised you? What do you want to remember? What homework did your therapist suggest? These four questions, answered quickly, can save weeks of re-covering the same ground.',
      '## Set a reminder',
      'Use your phone to set a recurring reminder for right after your session time. "Write session notes" — that\'s it. Future you will be grateful.',
      'Tools like Sessionly can automatically remind you after your session, making this even easier. The goal isn\'t to create a transcript. It\'s to capture the 2-3 things that mattered most while they\'re still fresh.',

    title: 'The Science-Backed Benefits of Journaling Between Therapy Sessions',
    excerpt: 'Journaling between sessions isn\'t busy work — it\'s one of the most evidence-based things you can do to accelerate your growth.',
    body: [
      'If your therapist has ever suggested journaling, you might have nodded politely while internally rolling your eyes. But the research is clear: people who journal between therapy sessions make faster progress and retain more from each session.',
      '## The evidence',
      'A 2021 meta-analysis found that expressive writing reduces symptoms of anxiety by 15-20% and depression by 10-15% when practiced consistently. Combined with therapy, the effects compound.',
      'Another study from the Journal of Clinical Psychology showed that clients who took notes between sessions reported feeling 40% more prepared and covered 30% more ground in each appointment.',
      '## Why it works',
      'Journaling between sessions does three things simultaneously: it extends the therapeutic process beyond the 50-minute hour, it creates a record you can reference later, and it helps your brain consolidate emotional learning through the act of writing itself.',
      'When you write about an experience, you\'re forced to organize it — to find words for feelings, to create a narrative. This organizational process is therapeutic in itself.',
      '## You don\'t need to write a lot',
      'The biggest misconception about therapeutic journaling is that it needs to be long or deep. It doesn\'t. A few sentences capturing what triggered you, how you felt, and what you noticed about your reaction is more than enough.',
      'Consistency beats depth. Three sentences every day is more valuable than three pages once a month.',
      '## Make it easy',
      'The best journaling system is the one you\'ll actually use. If a beautiful leather journal intimidates you, use your phone. If typing feels too formal, use voice notes. Remove every barrier between the experience and the capture.',

    title: 'How to Track Your Emotional Triggers (Without Getting Overwhelmed)',
    excerpt: 'Triggers aren\'t random. They follow patterns. Here\'s a simple framework for tracking them so you can bring real data to your next session.',
    body: [
      'A trigger hits and suddenly you\'re flooded. Angry, anxious, shut down — whatever your pattern is. In the moment, it feels like it came out of nowhere. But triggers are rarely random. They follow patterns. And tracking them is one of the most powerful things you can do in therapy.',
      '## What a trigger log actually looks like',
      'You don\'t need a complex system. When something triggers you, capture four things: What happened (the event). What you felt (the emotion). How intense it was (1-10). What you did (your response).',
      'That\'s it. Four data points. Takes 30 seconds.',
      '## Why this works',
      'After a few weeks of logging, patterns emerge. You might notice that most of your triggers involve feeling dismissed. Or that your anxiety spikes every Sunday evening. Or that certain people consistently activate your fight-or-flight response.',
      'These patterns are incredibly valuable in therapy. Instead of saying "I had a bad week," you can say "I was triggered three times this week, and all three involved situations where I felt like my needs didn\'t matter."',
      '## Don\'t try to analyze in the moment',
      'When you\'re triggered, your analytical brain is offline. Don\'t try to figure out why you\'re upset while you\'re upset. Just capture the raw data. The analysis happens later — in therapy, with professional support.',
      '## Common pitfalls',
      'Avoid judging your triggers ("I shouldn\'t be upset about this"). Avoid minimizing ("It wasn\'t that bad"). And avoid waiting too long to log — emotional memory fades fast. Capture it within an hour if you can.',
      'The goal isn\'t to stop having triggers. It\'s to understand them well enough that they lose some of their power over you.',

    title: 'What Is Therapy Homework — And Why Does It Matter So Much?',
    excerpt: 'Your therapist gave you "homework" and you\'re not sure what to do with it. Here\'s why it\'s the secret ingredient most people overlook.',
    body: [
      'Therapy homework. The phrase alone might make you cringe. But here\'s the thing: the work you do between sessions is where the real change happens. The therapy room is where you gain insight. The rest of the week is where you practice it.',
      '## What therapy homework actually is',
      'It\'s not worksheets (usually). Therapy homework can be anything: noticing when you people-please, practicing a breathing technique when anxious, having a difficult conversation, or simply observing your thoughts without acting on them.',
      'It\'s the bridge between understanding something intellectually and actually living differently.',
      '## Why people skip it',
      'Life gets busy. The insight that felt urgent on Tuesday feels abstract by Friday. And without a system to track what your therapist suggested, it\'s easy to walk into your next session with a sheepish "I forgot what I was supposed to do."',
      'This is normal. It\'s also fixable.',
      '## How to actually follow through',
      'Write it down before you leave the session. Don\'t rely on memory — we\'ve already established that post-session memory is unreliable. Ask your therapist to repeat the homework if needed.',
      'Break it into small, concrete steps. "Work on boundaries" is vague. "Say no to one social invitation this week without over-explaining" is actionable.',
      'Set a specific time for it. "I\'ll do my breathing exercises every morning while my coffee brews." Tie it to an existing habit.',
      '## Track your progress',
      'When you walk into your next session and can say "I practiced X three times this week — here\'s what I noticed," the conversation goes deeper, faster. You\'re not re-covering old ground. You\'re building on it.',

    title: 'Setting Boundaries: A Practical Guide for People Who Hate Conflict',
    excerpt: 'Boundaries aren\'t about being harsh. They\'re about being honest. Here\'s how to set them without blowing up your relationships.',
    body: [
      'If the word "boundaries" makes you break into a cold sweat, you\'re not alone. For people-pleasers, conflict-avoiders, and chronic over-givers, setting boundaries can feel as comfortable as performing surgery on yourself.',
      'But boundaries aren\'t walls. They\'re guidelines for how you want to be treated. And learning to set them is one of the most transformative skills you can develop — in therapy and in life.',
      '## Start small',
      'You don\'t need to start with your most difficult relationship. Practice with low-stakes situations first. Saying "I can\'t make it" to a social invitation without adding a lengthy excuse. Telling a coworker "I\'ll get back to you on that" instead of immediately saying yes.',
      '## Use the sandwich method',
      'If direct boundary-setting feels too confrontational, try this: lead with warmth, state the boundary, end with warmth. "I love spending time with you. I need to leave by 9 because I have an early morning. Let\'s plan something for next week."',
      '## Expect discomfort',
      'The first time you set a boundary, it will feel wrong. You might feel guilty, selfish, or anxious. This is normal. Your nervous system has been trained to prioritize other people\'s comfort. Retraining takes time.',
      '## Notice what happens',
      'Track it. When you set a boundary, write down what happened. How did the other person respond? How did you feel afterward? Over time, you\'ll notice that the catastrophe you feared rarely materializes.',
      '## Bring it to therapy',
      'Boundary-setting is one of the best things to work on with your therapist. They can help you rehearse difficult conversations, process the guilt, and celebrate the wins. Log your boundary attempts between sessions so you have concrete examples to discuss.',

    excerpt: 'Feeling like therapy is going in circles? These strategies will help you break through plateaus and make every session count.',
    body: [
      'Therapy isn\'t always linear. There are breakthroughs, plateaus, and sometimes it feels like you\'re going backward. If you\'re in a stuck period, that doesn\'t mean therapy isn\'t working. But there are things you can do to move through it faster.',
      '## Come with an intention',
      'Not a rigid agenda — an intention. "Today I want to understand why I keep avoiding difficult conversations." This gives your session a direction without boxing it in.',
      '## Be honest about what\'s not working',
      'If you\'ve been in therapy for months and feel like you\'re treading water, say so. "I feel stuck" is one of the most productive things you can say in therapy. It gives your therapist crucial information about how to adjust their approach.',
      '## Do the homework',
      'This one is straightforward. The clients who make the fastest progress are the ones who practice between sessions. Even imperfectly. Even inconsistently. Doing something is better than doing nothing.',
      '## Stay curious about resistance',
      'If you notice yourself avoiding certain topics, minimizing certain feelings, or forgetting to do your homework — get curious. Resistance isn\'t a character flaw. It\'s a protection mechanism. And understanding what it\'s protecting is often where the real work lives.',
      '## Track your progress',
      'It\'s hard to see growth when you\'re in the middle of it. Keeping a log of what you discuss, what you notice, and what changes week to week gives you a bird\'s-eye view of your journey. Three months from now, you\'ll be amazed at how far you\'ve come.',

    title: 'Understanding Your Emotional Patterns: The Key to Lasting Change',
    excerpt: 'Why do you keep ending up in the same situations? Your emotional patterns hold the answer — and recognizing them is the first step.',
    body: [
      'Have you ever looked at your life and thought, "Why does this keep happening to me?" The same type of conflict. The same kind of relationship dynamic. The same emotional spiral. It\'s not bad luck. It\'s a pattern.',
      '## What are emotional patterns?',
      'Emotional patterns are recurring responses — ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving that activate automatically in certain situations. They\'re learned, usually early in life, and they operate largely outside conscious awareness.',
      'For example: every time someone raises their voice, you shut down. Every time you make a mistake, you spiral into self-criticism. Every time someone asks for help, you say yes even when you\'re drowning. These are patterns.',
      '## How to start noticing them',
      'Patterns become visible through repetition. The more data points you have, the clearer they become. This is why logging your emotional experiences — triggers, reactions, intensity — is so valuable.',
      'After a few weeks of consistent logging, you might notice: "Wait, I\'ve felt this exact same way three times this month, and all three times it was triggered by feeling excluded."',
      '## The role of therapy',
      'Your therapist is trained to spot patterns you can\'t see yourself. But they need data to work with. The more you bring in — observations, journal entries, mood logs — the faster and more accurately they can help you understand what\'s driving your behavior.',
      '## Patterns aren\'t destiny',
      'The most important thing to understand about emotional patterns is that they can change. They were learned, which means they can be unlearned. But the first step is always awareness. You can\'t change what you can\'t see.',

      'For many people, the therapy room feels like a different world. The transition from your daily life into that quiet, intentional space can create a kind of cognitive reset. Your brain shifts from "doing mode" to "processing mode," and the doing-mode memories take a back seat.',

      'Write things down as they happen during the week. Don\'t try to remember them. Record them. A quick note on your phone. A voice memo. A log entry in an app. The medium doesn\'t matter. What matters is that you externalize the memory before you need it.',

    title: 'How to Talk to Your Therapist About Difficult Topics',
    excerpt: 'Some things feel impossible to say out loud. Here\'s how to approach the hardest conversations in therapy with less dread.',
    body: [
      'There\'s something you need to talk about. You know it. Your therapist probably senses it too. But every session, you dance around it. You fill the time with other things — important things, sure — but not the thing.',
      '## Name the avoidance',
      'Sometimes the easiest way to talk about a hard topic is to talk about the fact that it\'s hard to talk about. "There\'s something I need to bring up but I don\'t know how to start." That single sentence gives your therapist permission to meet you where you are.',
      '## Write it down and hand it over',
      'If saying it out loud feels impossible, write it down before your session. Hand the paper to your therapist. Or read it aloud. Having it written removes the pressure to find the right words in the moment.',
      '## Start with the feeling, not the fact',
      '"I feel ashamed about something" is easier to say than the thing itself. And it gives your therapist context for how to respond when you do share.',
      '## Remember: they\'ve heard it before',
      'Whatever you\'re carrying, your therapist has likely heard something similar from other clients. You\'re not going to shock them. You\'re not going to be judged. The therapy room is designed to hold exactly this kind of weight.',
      '## Go at your own pace',
      'You don\'t have to share everything in one session. It\'s okay to say "I want to tell you something, but I\'m not ready yet. I just want you to know it\'s there." That\'s progress too. Naming the door, even before you walk through it, is a step.',

    excerpt: 'Cognitive behavioral therapy is powerful, but only if you practice between sessions. Here are exercises that fit into real life.',
    body: [
      'CBT is one of the most well-researched forms of therapy. Its core premise is simple: your thoughts affect your feelings, which affect your behavior. Change the thoughts, change the cycle. But here\'s the catch — CBT requires practice between sessions.',
      '## Thought records',
      'When you notice a strong emotional reaction, write down the situation, the automatic thought that came up, the emotion you felt, and then challenge the thought with evidence. "Is this thought 100% true? What would I tell a friend who had this thought?"',
      '## Behavioral experiments',
      'Your therapist might ask you to test a belief. If you believe "everyone will judge me if I speak up in meetings," your experiment might be speaking up once and observing what actually happens. Record the prediction, the outcome, and what you learned.',
      '## Activity scheduling',
      'Depression often creates a vicious cycle: you feel bad, so you do less, which makes you feel worse. Activity scheduling breaks this by planning small, achievable activities that provide a sense of mastery or pleasure. Even making your bed counts.',
      '## Mindfulness check-ins',
      'Set three alarms throughout the day. When they go off, take 30 seconds to notice: what am I thinking? What am I feeling? What\'s happening in my body? Log it. This builds the self-awareness muscle that CBT depends on.',
      '## Exposure ladders',
      'If you\'re working on anxiety, your therapist might create a hierarchy of feared situations from least to most scary. Your homework is to practice the next step on the ladder each week. Document how it went and what you learned.',
      '## The key: track everything',
      'CBT homework works best when you track it. Not because your therapist is grading you, but because the data helps both of you understand what\'s shifting and what needs more work.',

    excerpt: 'Journaling isn\'t just a wellness trend — decades of research show it measurably improves mental health outcomes.',
    body: [
      'The idea that writing about your feelings helps isn\'t just folk wisdom. It\'s backed by decades of psychological research, starting with James Pennebaker\'s groundbreaking studies in the 1980s.',
      '## The Pennebaker effect',
      'Pennebaker found that people who wrote about traumatic experiences for just 15-20 minutes a day showed significant improvements in both mental and physical health. They had fewer doctor visits, lower blood pressure, and reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety.',
      '## How it works in the brain',
      'Writing about emotional experiences activates the prefrontal cortex — the brain region responsible for emotional regulation. When you put feelings into words, you\'re literally engaging the part of your brain that helps manage those feelings. Neuroscientists call this "affect labeling."',
      '## Journaling + therapy = compounding returns',
      'A 2019 study in Psychotherapy Research found that clients who journaled between therapy sessions showed 25% greater improvement in therapy outcomes compared to those who didn\'t. The journaling didn\'t replace therapy — it amplified it.',
      '## What kind of journaling works best?',
      'Expressive writing (writing about thoughts and feelings) is the most studied. But structured journaling — using prompts, tracking triggers, logging mood — has also shown strong results, especially for people who find free-writing intimidating.',
      '## Consistency over perfection',
      'The research is clear on one point: regularity matters more than length. Writing for 5 minutes every day is more effective than writing for an hour once a month. The habit of reflection is what drives the change.',
      'If you\'re in therapy and not journaling between sessions, you\'re leaving progress on the table. It doesn\'t have to be complicated. It just has to be consistent.',

    excerpt: 'Mood tracking works — but only if you stick with it. Here\'s how to build a sustainable practice.',
    body: [
      'Mood tracking has become a wellness staple, and for good reason. Understanding your emotional patterns over time gives you — and your therapist — invaluable data. But most people start mood tracking with enthusiasm and abandon it within two weeks.',
      '## Why mood tracking fails',
      'Most mood tracking systems are too demanding. Logging every emotion every hour isn\'t sustainable for anyone with a life. The apps that require you to rate 15 different dimensions three times a day are designed by engineers, not humans.',
      '## The minimum viable mood log',
      'You need three things: a timestamp, a mood rating (1-10 or even just bad/meh/okay/good/great), and optionally a one-sentence note about what was happening. That\'s it. Takes 10 seconds.',
      '## When to log',
      'Don\'t try to log continuously. Instead, log at natural transition points: when you wake up, after lunch, and before bed. Or even simpler: log whenever something shifts. You were fine, and now you\'re not. Log the shift.',
      '## The therapeutic value',
      'After a month of mood tracking, patterns emerge. Maybe your mood always dips on Sundays. Maybe you feel best after exercise. Maybe your anxiety correlates with certain people or situations.',
      'This data is therapeutic gold. Instead of saying "I\'ve been feeling anxious," you can say "I\'ve been anxious 4 out of 7 days this week, mostly in the evenings, mostly related to work deadlines." Your therapist can work with that.',
      '## Make it frictionless',
      'The best mood tracking is the kind you do without thinking about it. Tie it to something you already do — your morning coffee, your commute, brushing your teeth. One tap, one number, done.',

      'You just left therapy and you feel like you\'ve been through a washing machine. Raw. Tender. Maybe a little shaky. That hard session did important work, but now you need to take care of yourself.',
      '## Give yourself transition time',
      'Don\'t schedule anything important right after therapy. No big meetings. No difficult conversations. Give yourself at least 30 minutes of buffer time. Sit in your car. Walk around the block. Let the session settle.',
      '## Write it down (briefly)',
      'While it\'s fresh, capture the 2-3 things that felt most significant. You don\'t need to process them right now — just make sure they don\'t disappear. A few sentences or bullet points is enough.',
      '## Move your body',
      'Emotional processing gets stored in the body. A walk, some stretching, or even just shaking your hands can help discharge the physical tension that builds during intense emotional work.',
      '## Hydrate and eat something',
      'It sounds basic because it is. Emotional work is exhausting. Your blood sugar might have dropped. A glass of water and a snack can help stabilize your nervous system faster than you\'d think.',
      '## Be gentle with yourself',
      'After a hard session, you might feel irritable, tearful, or disconnected. This is normal. You just opened up something that was sealed shut for a reason. It takes time for your system to recalibrate.',
      '## Reach out if you need to',
      'If you feel genuinely unsafe or overwhelmed, it\'s okay to call your therapist. Most therapists will take a brief between-session check-in call. You\'re not being needy — you\'re being responsible about your care.',

      '## 1. You\'re noticing your patterns',
      'Even if you can\'t change them yet, the fact that you\'re seeing them is huge. "Oh, I\'m people-pleasing again" is a fundamentally different statement than just... people-pleasing without awareness.',
      '## 2. You feel things more (not less)',
      'Counterintuitively, feeling more — not less — is often a sign of progress. If you spent years numbing or avoiding, starting to feel again means your defenses are softening.',
      '## 3. You\'re questioning old narratives',
      '"Maybe I\'m not actually lazy — maybe I\'m exhausted from hypervigilance." If you\'re challenging the stories you\'ve told yourself for years, that\'s significant.',
      '## 4. Your relationships are shifting',
      'This might feel uncomfortable. As you change, the dynamics with people around you shift too. Some relationships get better. Some get harder. Both are signs of growth.',
      '## 5. You\'re doing your homework (even imperfectly)',
      'Engaging with the process between sessions, even inconsistently, shows investment in your own growth.',
      '## 6. You catch yourself earlier',
      'Maybe you still spiral, but you notice it on the third thought instead of the thirtieth. Maybe you still people-please, but you catch yourself mid-sentence. The lag time between reaction and awareness is shrinking.',
      '## 7. You have "boring" sessions sometimes',
      'If every session is a crisis, that might mean you\'re not doing the maintenance work in between. Having a session where you say "honestly, things have been pretty okay" is a milestone worth celebrating.',

    body: [
      'Your therapist gave you something to practice. You nodded. You meant it. And then the week passed and you didn\'t do it. Again. If this cycle feels familiar, you\'re not lazy or undisciplined. Resistance to therapy homework is incredibly common, and it\'s rarely about willpower.',
      '## Resistance is information',
      'In therapy, resistance isn\'t a problem to overcome — it\'s a signal to explore. Why are you avoiding this particular task? What comes up when you think about doing it? Fear? Overwhelm? A quiet belief that it won\'t work?',
      '## Common flavors of resistance',
      'Perfectionism: "If I can\'t do it perfectly, I won\'t do it at all." This is the most common form. The antidote is permission to do it badly. A half-finished thought record is infinitely more useful than a perfect one you never start.',
      'Avoidance: The homework asks you to look at something you\'d rather not see. Sitting with uncomfortable feelings, challenging a core belief, confronting a relationship pattern. Avoidance is a protection mechanism, and it deserves compassion, not judgment.',
      'Overwhelm: The task feels too big. If "practice setting boundaries" feels like climbing Everest, break it into the smallest possible step: "Notice one moment this week where I wanted to say no but didn\'t."',
      '## What to do about it',
      'Talk to your therapist. "I didn\'t do the homework because..." is one of the most productive conversations you can have. It turns avoidance into material. It makes the resistance itself part of the work.',
      'Lower the bar dramatically. Do 10% of the homework. Do it badly. Do it for one minute instead of ten. The goal is to break the avoidance pattern, not to achieve perfection.',

      'Commit to writing one sentence a day. Just one. "Today was hard." "I felt lonely after dinner." "Work meeting went well — surprised myself." One sentence, every day, builds the habit that everything else grows from.',
      '## Choose your medium',
      'Don\'t force yourself to use a physical notebook if you\'re a phone person. Don\'t force an app if you love paper. The best journal is the one you\'ll actually open. Some people use voice memos. Some people text themselves. All valid.',
